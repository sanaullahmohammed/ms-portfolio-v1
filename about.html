        <p>Hey, I'm Mohammed.</p>
        <p>
          I'm a <strong>Software Design Engineer</strong> at Achieve.ai m,
          working on the development of 5 high-traffic websites and mobile
          applications that cater to millions of users preparing for competitive
          exams.

          As a child, I was captivated by the magic of video games and curious
          about how they were built. As I grew older, my interest in technology
          expanded, and I became fascinated with fixing computer hardware and
          understanding how operating systems functioned. This marked the
          beginning of my tech journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays, I love creating websites and applications using various
          stacks, whether it's as simple as a single HTML file or as complex as
          a MERN, .NET, or T3 stack. Beyond work, I enjoy building personal
          projects that allow me to delve deeper into the technologies that
          intrigue me and develop innovative solutions. Lately, I have been
          focusing on working with Ethereum blockchain and webRTC to build some
          exciting applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my passion for technology, I also believe in the
          importance of physical and mental fitness. I enjoy powerlifting and
          cycling, which helps me clear my mind and energizes me for the day
          ahead.
